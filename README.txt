//What is this
////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
This is a system of .cfg files that control all aspects of the game.

Using this, you have full control over what volvo gave you in-game, meaning you can tweak every aspect of the game by modifying text files. You can do special functions and keybinds that are not possible otherwise from the in-game menu.
 
This was originally set up by loopuleasa at https://github.com/loopuleasa/super-compact-dota2-keybinds.git
 
 
////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//How to set it up
////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
1. Remove all in-game keybinds (by left clicking a bind, then right clicking). Do this for all your binds.
 
2. Choose one of the keyboard layouts in the various folders you see here and copy the insides to \Steam\SteamApps\common\dota 2 beta\dota\cfg\
 
3. You can modify the files however you want to match your preference

4. Once the game loads, the autoexec.cfg gets executed automatically. Alternatively, press (default) F8 in-game to reload it.
 
 
 
 
////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//How it works?
////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
I turned the autoexec.cfg file that is loaded and executed automatically by the dota2 client into an engine that loads and combines the other .cfg files I created into a flexible keyboard layout that is easy to modify once you get the hang of it. 

Take a sniff through files, because I read many readme files laying around and in each .cfg files there are usually plenty of comments.

Each config file has its role.

Contact me on reddit at /u/loopuleasa and I might add it to the main repository for people to see and I shall give you credit.
